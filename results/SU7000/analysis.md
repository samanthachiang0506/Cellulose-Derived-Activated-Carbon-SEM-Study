# SU7000 Imaging Analysis

The Hitachi SU7000 demonstrated strong performance in low-voltage, surface-sensitive
imaging of cellulose-derived activated carbon. Its multi-detector configuration and
high signal efficiency allowed detailed observation of pore morphology across a range
of working distances and detector modes.

## 1. Low-Voltage Imaging Performance (0.20–1.00 kV)

The SU7000 was able to consistently produce clear images at accelerating voltages
as low as 0.20 kV, capturing fine surface details and edge contrast that are
characteristic of porous carbon materials.

### Key observations:
- At **0.20 kV**, clear surface features were visible, but the “contamination box”
  artifact appeared due to prolonged beam exposure and hydrocarbon deposition.
- At **1.00 kV**, images showed improved sharpness with minimal charging,
  making this the optimal range for surface morphology characterization.

This low-voltage capability is particularly important for activated carbon,
where higher voltages may penetrate too deeply and obscure surface features.

## 2. Detector Mode Comparison (LD, MD, UD)

Detector mode had a significant impact on image contrast and extraction of
surface information.

### LD (Lower Detector)
- Broader contrast range  
- Reduced surface detail  
- Useful for overall morphology but not ideal for pore analysis  

### MD (Middle Detector)
- Balanced brightness and contrast  
- Good for intermediate WD imaging  
- Captures general shape and texture features  

### UD (Upper Detector)
- Highest surface sensitivity  
- Best visibility of pore edges and fine carbon structures  
- Most suitable for analyzing mesoporous textures  

Overall, **UD** was the preferred mode for high-resolution surface characterization.

## 3. Working Distance Effects (2.8 mm vs 6.7 mm)

Images acquired at short working distance (WD = 2.8 mm) showed substantially higher
resolution compared to those at 6.7 mm.

### At 2.8 mm:
- Sharper morphological features  
- Clear pore edges  
- Reduced noise  

### At 6.7 mm:
- Increased depth of field  
- Slight loss in fine detail  
- Useful for larger particle structures but less effective for porosity analysis  

Short WD consistently produced superior results for activated carbon imaging.

## 4. Pore Size Measurement (Mesopores vs Macropores)

Two sets of images were used to quantify pore sizes:

### Mesopores (~20 nm)
- Measured at 1.00 kV, 2.5 mm WD, 250k× magnification  
- Average pore diameter: **21.89 nm**  
- These pores form a continuous fine network characteristic of activated carbon precursors

### Macropores (~2–3 μm)
- Measured at 0.20 kV, 2.5 mm WD, 2.50k× magnification  
- Average pore size: **2.493 μm**  
- These larger features correspond to structural cracks and voids formed during pyrolysis

The SU7000 successfully resolved features across multiple length scales due to its
low-voltage efficiency and detector design.

## 5. Summary of SU7000 Performance

- Strong low-voltage capability (down to 0.20 kV)  
- Excellent surface sensitivity using UD detector  
- High resolution at short WD  
- Effective capture of both mesoporous and macroporous structures  
- Occasional contamination artifacts during long exposure  

Overall, the SU7000 is well-suited for porous carbon characterization, offering
high-contrast imaging and detailed morphological information across a wide range 
of operating conditions.
