# SU3500 Imaging Analysis

The Hitachi SU3500 demonstrated stable operation at mid-range accelerating voltages 
but showed clear limitations when imaging low-density, porous carbon materials at 
low voltage. Its detector configuration and signal efficiency were not sufficient to 
produce usable images below ~1 kV.

## 1. Low-Voltage Performance (0.30 kV)

At 0.30 kV, the SU3500 was unable to generate a meaningful image. The output frame 
displayed a near-uniform dark field, indicating that:

- The secondary electron signal was below the detector sensitivity threshold  
- Beam landing energy was insufficient for surface excitation  
- Charging and noise dominated the detected signal  
- The system’s low-kV imaging capability is significantly weaker than that of the SU7000  

This result reinforces that the SU3500 is not suitable for high-surface-sensitivity 
applications or low-voltage imaging of carbonaceous materials.

## 2. Working Distance Effects (6.3 mm vs 10.4 mm)

Images acquired at **WD = 6.3 mm** were visibly sharper and contained better contrast 
compared to those at **WD = 10.4 mm**.

### WD = 6.3 mm
- Higher resolution  
- Sharper outlines of carbon flakes  
- Reduced beam spreading  

### WD = 10.4 mm
- Lower image sharpness  
- Reduced fine-detail visibility  
- Larger effective interaction volume  

Although SU3500 can operate across a wide WD range, short WD configurations remain 
superior for resolving activated carbon microstructures.

## 3. Accelerating Voltage Comparison (5 kV, 10 kV, 20 kV)

At mid- to high-voltage settings, the SU3500 produced stable images with improved 
brightness and contrast, though at the cost of reduced surface sensitivity.

### 5 kV
- Good balance between contrast and resolution  
- Surface textures partially visible  
- Moderate penetration depth  

### 10 kV
- Increased brightness and signal strength  
- Enhanced visibility of larger carbon fragments  
- Some loss of surface-specific information  

### 20 kV
- Deep penetration into the material  
- Dominant bulk contrast  
- Least suitable for surface-level pore analysis  

Overall, the SU3500 performs reliably at 5–20 kV but lacks the low-kV versatility 
needed for surface-sensitive imaging.

## 4. Comparison with SU7000 Under Similar Conditions (1.00 kV)

When operated at 1.00 kV and similar working distances, the SU3500 showed:

- Lower surface detail  
- Less-defined pore boundaries  
- Lower signal-to-noise ratio  
- Reduced contrast in thin carbon sheets  

Meanwhile, the SU7000 preserved surface roughness, pore edges, and particle morphology 
with visibly stronger clarity.

These differences reflect the inherent detector and electron-optical improvements in 
the SU7000 platform.

## 5. Summary of SU3500 Performance

Strengths:
- Stable operation at mid- and high voltages  
- Acceptable resolution for general morphology studies  
- Wide working distance flexibility  

Limitations:
- Poor low-voltage sensitivity (<1 kV)  
- Reduced surface contrast for low-Z materials  
- Limited ability to resolve nanoscale pore structures  

The SU3500 is suitable for general SEM imaging but is not optimized for 
fine-scale analysis of porous carbon materials, especially when low-voltage 
surface characterization is required.
