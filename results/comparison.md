# Comparison Between SU7000 and SU3500 SEM Systems

This document summarizes the key differences observed between the Hitachi SU7000 
and SU3500 based on imaging performance, detector behavior, and parameter sensitivity 
during the characterization of cellulose-derived activated carbon.

The comparison is based on matched imaging conditions, including similar accelerating 
voltages, working distances, and magnifications.

## 1. Low-Voltage Imaging Capability

### SU7000
- Capable of generating clear images down to **0.20 kV**
- High detector sensitivity enables strong surface contrast
- Suitable for analyzing fine pore structures and surface roughness

### SU3500
- Unable to form an image at **0.30 kV**
- Insufficient signal generation at low landing energies
- Not suitable for surface-sensitive characterization of low-density materials

**Conclusion:**  
The SU7000 provides substantially better low-voltage performance and is preferred for 
porous carbon imaging where shallow interaction volume is required.

## 2. Detector System Performance

### SU7000
- Offers multiple secondary electron detectors (LD, MD, UD)
- UD mode captures high-resolution surface details
- Clear detector-dependent contrast differences observed

### SU3500
- Detector configuration optimized for general imaging
- Less variation between detector modes
- Lower contrast for carbon-based surfaces

**Conclusion:**  
Detector flexibility and sensitivity in the SU7000 significantly enhance surface feature 
visibility compared to the SU3500.

## 3. Working Distance Sensitivity

### SU7000
- Strong improvement in clarity at short WD (2.8 mm)
- Able to maintain detail even at moderate WD (6.7 mm)
- Electron optics optimized for high-resolution operation

### SU3500
- Short WD (6.3 mm) provides best clarity
- Longer WD (10.4 mm) results in noticeable image degradation
- More sensitive to WD changes than SU7000

**Conclusion:**  
Both systems benefit from short WD, but the SU7000 maintains higher resolution across 
a wider WD range.

## 4. Accelerating Voltage Behavior

### SU7000
- Maintains contrast and detail at low voltages (0.20–1.00 kV)
- Surface features preserved even at high magnification
- Ideal for porous carbon analysis

### SU3500
- Performs best at mid-range voltages (5–10 kV)
- Higher voltages (20 kV) reduce surface sensitivity
- Does not resolve nanoscale features effectively

**Conclusion:**  
SU7000 supports multi-scale imaging from mesopores (~20 nm) to macropores (~2–3 μm), 
while SU3500 is more suited for bulk morphology imaging.

## 5. Overall Image Quality

### SU7000
- Superior surface contrast
- Higher signal-to-noise ratio
- Better por
