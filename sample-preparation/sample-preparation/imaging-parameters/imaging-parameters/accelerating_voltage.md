# Accelerating Voltage

Accelerating voltage directly affects beam penetration depth, surface sensitivity, 
and the overall contrast of carbon-based materials.

### Low Voltage (0.2–1 kV)
- High surface sensitivity  
- Minimal beam penetration  
- Strong edge contrast  
- Suitable for porous carbon where surface detail is important  
- Requires sensitive detectors (SU7000 performs significantly better than SU3500)

### Mid Voltage (2–5 kV)
- Balanced surface detail and brightness  
- Increased signal from deeper regions of the material  
- Useful for identifying pore network boundaries  

### High Voltage (>5 kV)
- Higher brightness but reduced surface-specific information  
- Not ideal for lightweight carbon samples due to deeper penetration  
- Increased risk of charging and beam-induced damage  

### Summary
Low accelerating voltage provides the best surface information for activated carbon, 
but requires a detector system capable of maintaining contrast at low beam energy.
