# Working Distance

Working distance (WD) affects resolution, depth of field, detector efficiency, 
and overall imaging performance in SEM.

### Short Working Distance (2–6 mm)
- Higher resolution  
- Improved image sharpness  
- Strong surface detail visibility  
- Preferred for high-detail imaging of activated carbon  
- SU7000 shows optimal performance at short WD values

### Medium Working Distance (6–12 mm)
- Increased depth of field  
- Slight reduction in resolution  
- Suitable for general overview images

### Long Working Distance (>12 mm)
- Noticeable loss of resolution  
- Reduced surface detail  
- Not recommended for pore-structure or fine morphological analysis

### Summary
Working distance has one of the strongest influences on SEM image clarity. Short 
working distance consistently provides the highest quality images for porous, 
carbon-based materials.
