# Sample Preparation Workflow for Activated Carbon SEM Imaging

This document summarizes the preparation steps used to mount and prepare 
cellulose-derived activated carbon samples for SEM imaging on the Hitachi SU3500 
and SU7000 systems. Activated carbon is a porous, low-density, and electrically 
non-conductive material; therefore, careful preparation is required to minimize 
charging and ensure stable imaging.

## 1. Sample Selection and Handling

Activated carbon particles with representative morphology were selected from the 
bulk material. Care was taken to avoid excessive fragmentation during handling.

Two categories of sample features were prepared for imaging:

- Fractured surfaces for macrostructure observation  
- Fine carbon particulates for pore-scale examination

## 2. Mounting on SEM Stub

A standard aluminum SEM stub was used as shown in Fig. 2.  
The mounting procedure was as follows:

1. A layer of **conductive carbon tape** was applied to the stub surface.  
2. Carbon particles were gently pressed into the tape to ensure mechanical stability.  
3. Excess loose particulates were removed using an air blower to prevent contamination inside the SEM chamber.  
4. The mounting location was selected to match the field of view of the SEM's optical navigation system.

This ensured good physical adherence and minimized movement during stage tilting or 
focus adjustments.

## 3. Conductive Coating

Since activated carbon has low electrical conductivity at the microscale, sputter 
coating was applied to minimize charging under the electron beam.

- **Gold coating** was deposited using the sputter coater available in the facility.  
- Coating thickness was kept minimal to avoid obscuring small pore structures.  
- A uniform coating ensured consistent imaging between SU3500 and SU7000.

This step was essential for stable low- and mid-voltage operation, particularly for 
the SU3500, which is more sensitive to charging artifacts.

## 4. Verification Using SEM Optical Navigation

Before imaging, the mounted sample was inspected through the SEM's optical map:

- The region of interest was identified on the optical overlay  
- The optical center was aligned with the electron beam landing point  
- Multiple points were designated for high- and low-magnification imaging  

This process ensured that repeated imaging between instruments and parameter sets 
was performed on consistent areas of the sample.
